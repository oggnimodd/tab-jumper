# Tab Jumper

Tab Jumper is a browser extension that allows you to quickly jump between tabs.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oggnimodd/tab-jumper.git
    cd tab-jumper
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Development

1.  **Build the extension:**

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Start development mode (with hot-reloading):**

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

3.  **Run the extension in a browser:**

    ```bash

    This will open a new browser window with the extension loaded. Any changes you make in development mode will automatically reload in the browser.
